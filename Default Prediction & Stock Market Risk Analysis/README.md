# Project Title: Default Prediction & Stock Market Risk Analysis

## üìÑ Project Description
The **Default Prediction & Stock Market Risk Analysis** focuses on building a Financial Health Assessment Tool for evaluating the financial stability and creditworthiness of companies. The tool uses machine learning to classify companies as defaulters or non-defaulters based on their financial metrics, enabling stakeholders to:
- Identify companies at financial risk.
- Make informed decisions regarding debt management and investments.
- Implement proactive risk mitigation strategies.

This project also includes a stock market analysis, highlighting stock performance trends, returns, and volatility for improved investment strategies.

## ‚ú® Key Results and Insights
### Part A: Financial Health Assessment
- **Logistic Regression**:
  - Initial recall for defaulters: 0.01 (poor performance).
  - Improved recall post-feature reduction and SMOTE: 0.25.
- **Random Forest**:
  - Recall on test set post-optimization: 0.22.
- Neither model performed adequately for real-world application. Recommendations for PCA or ensemble techniques like Boosting/Bagging for further improvement.

### Part B: Stock Market Analysis
- Stocks analyzed: Bharti Airtel, Yes Bank, ITC Limited, DLF, Tata Motors.
- **Insights**:
  - Bharti Airtel and ITC Limited provide mid-range returns with low volatility.
  - Yes Bank has high volatility with the least returns.
  - Diversification strategies combining low-risk and high-return stocks are optimal for risk-adjusted returns.
